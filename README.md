Python is an interpreted, object-oriented, high-level language with dynamic semantics, making it attractive for rapid application development and as a scripting language. Its simple and easy-to-learn syntax emphasizes readability, reducing the cost of program maintenance. Python supports modules and packages, encouraging program modularity and code reuse. It can be used in a procedural, object-oriented, or functional way, and it is available in two major versions: Python 2 and Python 3, with Python 3 being the most recent major version. Python's extensive standard library and active community make it a powerful tool for various programming tasks.
